            <h2 class="mb-3">Types of Businesses</h2>
            <p>There are various types, This article covers Just five of them which include.</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/image2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <h5>1. Sole Proprietorship</h5>
            <p>A Sole Proprietorship (trivially known as enterprise) is a type of business entity that is usually owned and operated by one person.</p>
            <p> This type of business does not enjoy the benefits of limited liability and there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business. Before the law, the owner and the business are one and the same.</p>
            <p>Sole proprietorships are the simplest of all business entities. They are cheap and easy to set up and require little capital.</p>   
            <p>The major downside of this business entity is its unlimited liability. The owner of this type of business bears the risk alone and may be personally liable to repay any debts the business owes.</p>
            <p>Another disadvantage of this entity is that it’s difficult to continue if the owner dies or cannot continue running the business.</p>


            
            <h5>2. It protects you from personal liability</h5>
            <p>This is arguably the biggest reason why many people have to register their business. Without the legal protection of limited liability, you could lose your business and personal property if something goes wrong (say somebody sues you to court for heavy damages).</p>
            <p>Imagine you started a Delivery Service Business and your dispatch drivers carry goods to clients across
              the country.
              Unfortunately, one day, one of the riders knocked down someone on the street with the motorbike that
              resulted to death of the person.
              Your biggest problem is the case brought against you in court by the relatives of the person killed in that
              accident. They are suing you for damages of up to ¢250,000. Even if you sold the other remaining
              motorbikes, it wouldn’t still be enough to settle such a high sum.
            </p>

            <p>How much money you lose in this scenario really depends on the nature of your business.
              If your business is registered as a limited liability entity, the worst that could happen is that ONLY your
              business will be responsible for paying the damages because it is a separate entity from you.
              However, if you were running an unregistered business, you may not be entirely safe. Why? Because
              your personal stuff (house, cars, money in the bank etc) maybe used to settle any outstanding debts the
              business cannot settle.
            </p>

            <p>Don’t forget, not all company types can offer this protection. Only Limited Liability type companies can
              do this. Sole-proprietorships and partnerships (except Limited Liability Partnerships) cannot provide
              protection from personal liability.
            </p><br>

            <h5>3. It makes you look serious and attracts more customers</h5>
            <p>In today’s modern world, most customers, especially corporate customers, expect a serious and
              responsible business to be registered.
              In fact, most companies will not do business with an unregistered business. In certain cases, it’s against
              the law for regulatory and tax reasons.
              Imagine your business is not registered, how can you issue receipts to customers for products you sell or
              services delivered?
            </p>
            <p>And who exactly pays for something these days without demanding a receipt? Unless your plan for your
              business is to become and remain a petty trading business that sells stuff off street corners, you just
              have to register it to attract more discerning customers.
              Nobody says you can’t survive with a business that isn’t registered. The likely outcome is that you may
              not grow and will probably remain small for a long time.
            </p><br>

            <h5>4. It’s easier to get bank credit and investment from investors</h5>
            <p>For banks, there are basically two categories of loans; Personal and Business loans. They’re both totally
              different and one cannot be used to represent the other.
              As a result, most banks will gladly lend you money to buy a new car or house but none will give you
              money to fund a business that isn’t registered. To qualify for a business loan, the Number 1 and nonnegotiable
              requirement is that your business must be registered. Period!
              For investors, it’s the same thing. Investors are interested in giving you money for a share of your
              business, and not to finance your personal lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>If there’s no registered business, what exactly will you be giving them a share of?
              Investors want to know that your business is organized, exists legally and is separate from your personal
              life and finances.
              No investor would take you seriously if you’re asking for investment but you don’t already have your
              business registered. To them, it’s a sign of unseriousness and a lack of professionalism. You don’t want
              anybody to have that impression of you.
            </p><br>

            <h5>5. It’s important for continuity sake</h5>
            <p>Apple Inc, Nestle,Ghandour, Shell and Toyota. Do these names ring a bell?
              Of course they do.
              These names are big multi-billion dollar businesses that have existed for years. In fact, most of the
              people who formed these companies have been dead for a long time.
              Nevertheless, these businesses, which were quite small when they started many years ago, remain very
              big and successful today.
            </p>
            <p>It’s called continuity; human beings live and die but businesses have the ability to last forever as they
              are transferred from one generation to another.
              In Africa, it’s hard to come across businesses that outlast their founders. Just a few have.
            </p>
            <p>A registered business is an asset (like a house, car and other properties) that can be passed down (as an
              inheritance) or sold by its owners to a new generation of people who can continue to own and run the
              business.
              Registering your business will help you achieve your dreams of continuity.
            </p><br>
